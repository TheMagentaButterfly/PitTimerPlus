[What is PitTimerPlus?]

PitTimerPlus is an LSPDFR Plugin I've developed which keeps track of how long a pursuit has been running for and when you're allowed to radio in to request a pit maneuver.
Your Pursuit has to be running for a certain amount of time for you to be allowed to perform a pit maneuver.
Please have a look at the "PitTimerPlusSettings.ini" file for message and time duration customizations.

If anyone wants to use any code of this plugin, they are free to do so just maybe give some credit here and there. Happy coding ^^


[!DISCLAIMER!]

There will be bugs and this plugin is not fully ironed out yet so please give me time to work on this. The Source code will be put on my GitHub for anyone who is interested!
