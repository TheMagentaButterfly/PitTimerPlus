## What is PitTimerPlus?

PitTimerPlus is an LSPDFR Plugin I've developed that tracks how long the pursuit has been running and when you're allowed to radio in to request a pit maneuver.
Your pursuit must run for a certain amount of time before you can perform a pit maneuver.
Please have a look at the `PitTimerPlusSettings.ini` file for message and time duration customizations.

[Here is an example of a pit timer being used during a pursuit by Jeff Favignano on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxXq2JViytZbsGfPGDB2prgAwKqXh94VYp)



If anyone wants to use any code of this plugin, they are free to do so just maybe give some credit here and there. Happy coding ^^
