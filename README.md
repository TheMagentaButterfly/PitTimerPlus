//What is PitTimerPlus?\\

PitTimerPlus is an LSPDFR Plugin I've developed that keeps track of how long a pursuit has been running and when youâ€™re allowed to request a pit maneuver via radio. Your pursuit must be active for a certain amount of time before you are permitted to perform a pit maneuver. Please refer to the "PitTimerPlusSettings.ini" file for message and time duration customizations.

If anyone wants to use any source code from this plugin, they are free to do so. Just maybe give some credit here and there. Happy coding!
